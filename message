Hi Jonas,

I have more specific information that narrows down the login issue:

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ WORKS: http://127.0.0.1:5173/ (local IP address)
- ❌ FAILS: http://localhost:5173/ (localhost hostname)  
- ❌ FAILS: https://buildlabz.xyz/ (production domain)

**What This Means:**
Your cookie configuration is inconsistent across different environments. The cookies work when accessed from an IP address (127.0.0.1) but fail with hostnames (localhost, buildlabz.xyz).

This suggests that your cookie Domain and SameSite settings are:
1. Too restrictive for hostname-based domains
2. Working correctly for IP-based origins
3. Inconsistent across different origin types

**Required Fix:**
Please ensure your cookie settings work consistently for:
- IP addresses (127.0.0.1)
- Localhost hostnames  
- Production domains (buildlabz.xyz)

The cookies should be set with proper `Domain` and `SameSite` attributes that work across all these environments.
